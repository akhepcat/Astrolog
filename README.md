# Astrolog 7.20

This is a copy of the "official" version of Astrolog 7.20 (released April 11, 2020) described at: http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog.htm

The files here were copied from: http://www.astrolog.org/ftp/ast72src.zip

A number of changes have been applied in order to build this project against
ubuntu 2021.04 (Hirsute) and remediate a number of buffer-overruns in string
handling.

Only minor testing has been done for this rework, but everything tested is
working except for those documented in ERRORS.md
